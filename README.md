# [False Friends](https://false-friends.netlify.app/)
## ‚öΩ A gyrosensor game, where you control a rolling ball only by the motion of your device.<br>üï≥Ô∏è Your goal is to finish all levels as quickly as possible, while avoiding various obstacles on your way.


Built as a [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) the game is natively installable on almost all platforms, e. g. Android and Windows, just by clicking the **Install App**/**Add to Homescreen** Button in the browser.  
Nevertheless the game is fully playable in the web, but not all browsers allow reading of device motion data.

This fun little project was a seminar paper for university.
